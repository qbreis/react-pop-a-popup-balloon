# Chapter #4 - Part #3 - Refactoring

To refactor my code, I want to consider a few improvements:

- **Combine useState calls**: If multiple state variables are logically related, I can group them into a single state object.

- **Consolidate similar logic**: I have similar logic for starting and stopping the game, so I can consolidate it into a single function.

All this is discussed in [Refactor kode useState dan useEffect](https://chat.openai.com/c/cb1556e3-4db3-48d9-97e5-b0f92fa39602)
